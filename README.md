QtWebMConverter is a simple, cross-platform, Qt-based frontend for ffmpeg aimed at making WebM videos.

Currently it supports VP8/VP9 and Vorbis/Opus in a WebM container. It only supports CRF encoding mode (because that's the one you want to use 9 out of 10 times anyway). More support (including other containers/codecs) might be added in the future.
